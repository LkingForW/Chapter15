# Chapter15 C++ as a Better C: Introducing Object Technology

### 15.5
Write a C++ programn that promts the usser for the raius of a circle, then calls an inline function circleArea to calculate the area of that circle.

### 15.6
Write a complete C++ programn with the two alternate function specification specified below, each of which simple triples the variable count defined in main. Then compare and constrast the two appraches. These two functionalities are
A) function tripleByValue that passes a copy of count by value, triples the copy then returns the new value
b) function tripleByReference that passes count by reference via reference parameter, and triples the original value of count through its alias.

### 15.8 
Write a programn that uses a function template called min to determine the smaller of two arguments. Test the program using integers, characters and floating-pont number arguments.

### 15.9 
Write a program that uses a function template called max to determine the larger of two arguments. Test the program using integer, character and floating-point number arguments.

C How to Program Exercise Files ( Seventh Edition) by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel Keep in mind that these are by no means the best solutions to these problems. I simply started this to help other developers and to teach myself.
